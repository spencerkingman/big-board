The big board is a way for me to organize thoughts and ideas in pursuit of a general strategy. It is very much a work in progress. Each page is organized in the same way. The A, B, C, and D sections have the following meanings:

<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="a">A</h2>

<p>What are the problems?</p>

<h2 id="b">B</h2>

<p>What is the ideal?</p>

<h2 id="c">C</h2>

<p>What is to be done?</p>

<h2 id="d">D</h2>

<p>What can we learn from?</p>

  </div>
