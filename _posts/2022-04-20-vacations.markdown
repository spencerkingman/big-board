## A

Air Travel burns a ton of carbon; Cruises destructive; Vacations don't actually expose you to foreigners; Vacations not actually relaxing; Only rich people can go on vacations; No time off for emergencies or childbirth; No extended vacation times; Weekends and federal holidays are not enough. Holidays are commercialized and superficial

## B

Vacation lotteries or social timeshare system; Rail and airships and sailboats; Diffuse, public vacation infrastructure and workforce; Public resorts; Public management and sharing of most desirable vacation spots; Protection of special lands; One year off for every 6 years of work; 32 hour work week; Random days off for everyone in addition to shared holidays; Universal federal holidays; Public investment in virtual travel experiences (of art, architecture, cities, natural wonders, ruins) to expose people while decreasing travel and wear on the sites.

## C

What is to be done?

## D

Soviet Union. Virtual Reality. The Parks service. How do rich people vacation, and what can be socialized responsibly from that?
