## A

Power of judges; bad jury system; opacity of the system; difficulty of normal, non-rich people to access and navigate the system; fees and fines; Supreme Court is insulated from democratic pressures, elitist, reactionary, gerontocratic, destabilizing, lacking legitimacy, unaccountable, too powerful. The federal appointments system seems politicized but not in a rational way. 

## B

What is the ideal?

## C

Changes to the way judges are appointed and tenured. Legislative limits to their power? Professional jurists?

## D

_Taming Democracy_ tells an interesting story of how judicial appointments and tax collection played into the battle over the US constitution drafting and ratification.
