## A

### Scarcity Framing

Pay-go logics.

### Corporate Tax Avoidance

- There are many tactics available to tax escapees
  - Avoid reporting income
  - Solicit huge IP and natural resource gifts from the government
  - Inflate expenses
  - Defer income indefinitely into the future
  - Corporations are able to create paper subsidiaries or claim their profits in foreign jurisdictions (Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos).
- Complex tax laws in the US are easy for corporations to manipulate and maneuver in. They are also difficult for the IRS to enforce.
  - The complexity makes it easier for politicians to include provisions in the code that benefit industries and firms that lobby them.
    - These insertions can be made in such a way that it is hard to understand who is behind them.
  - The IRS is not staffed in a way that allows them to investigate complex corporate tax evasion cases. As a result, most of the punitive action of the IRS is against the small-scale tax evasion of individuals.
  - The media's capacity to investigate and report on tax law and tax cheating is also shrinking rapidly.
- Since 1950 the share of government revenue coming from corporate income tax has shrunk from 30% to 10%, replaced mostly by regressive payroll taxes.

### Regressive Taxation

- Capital gains and dividends are taxed at a maximum of 15 percent.
- Labor is taxed at a higher rate.
- Regressive payroll and sales taxes are often not included in considerations of the tax burden of individual households.
