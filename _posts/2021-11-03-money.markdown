## A

### Scarcity Framing

Pay-go logics.

### Corporate Tax Avoidance

- There are many tactics available to tax escapees
  - Avoid reporting income
  - Solicit huge IP and natural resource gifts from the government
  - Inflate expenses
  - Defer income indefinitely into the future
  - Corporations are able to create paper subsidiaries or claim their profits in foreign jurisdictions (Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos).
- Complex tax laws in the US are easy for corporations to manipulate and maneuver in. They are also difficult for the IRS to enforce.
  - The complexity makes it easier for politicians to include provisions in the code that benefit industries and firms that lobby them.
    - These insertions can be made in such a way that it is hard to understand who is behind them.
  - The IRS is not staffed in a way that allows them to investigate complex corporate tax evasion cases. As a result, most of the punitive action of the IRS is against the small-scale tax evasion of individuals.
  - The media's capacity to investigate and report on tax law and tax cheating is also shrinking rapidly.
- Since 1950 the share of government revenue coming from corporate income tax has shrunk from 30% to 10%, replaced mostly by regressive payroll taxes.

### Regressive Taxation

- Capital gains and dividends are taxed at a maximum of 15 percent.
- Labor is taxed at a higher rate.
- Regressive payroll and sales taxes are often not included in considerations of the distribution of the tax burden.

### Public Consciousness

### Taxes To Protect Society

#### Society can use taxes to limit and discourage certain types of economic activity.

##### Financial Speculation

- **Financial Transaction Tax (Robin Hood Tax)** - Barbara Lee and Bernie Sanders' bill would deter unproductive, high frequency trading by levying a small tax on trades of stocks, bonds, and derivatives (0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.005% respectively). Like sales tax, this would discourage arbitrage (aka speculative resell). 40 countries already levy a similar tax. The United States did between 1916 and 1966, and currently the US levies a very small fee on some transactions. If implemented, traders may attempt to circumvent by routing transactions through foreign markets or trading options instead of stocks. They would also attempt to pass on the fees to investors, including pension and insurance funds. A tax like this could raise approximately 200 billion dollars revenue a year.
- **Tobin Tax** - A 1% (or less) tax on spot currency trades made by banks and financial institutions that profit from market volatility by taking excessive short-term speculative positions in the currency markets. It is intended to stabilize currencies and discourage speculation. Without this protection, money can move quickly between countries depending on interest rates. A sudden currency sell-off caused by an interest rate spike elsewhere can create a crisis if the central bank does not have enough cash in reserve to balance. This unpredictability makes it hard for countries to pursue independent monetary policies. Italy currently imposes this tax, but in order to be truly effective it would have to be adopted internationally.
- **Higher Penalties for Corporate Crime** - Stiffer fees for corporate malfeasance could deter crime by changing the cost-benefit calculation.

##### Pollution

- **Carbon Tax** -

##### Addictive Industries

- Alcohol
- Tobacco
- Gambling
- Junk Food
- Tech

#### Society can use taxes to prevent the accumulation of extreme wealth and redistribute wealth more equally.
